Reflections on lesson 2:
========================

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Git starts tracking the content in the directory. To create a "mounting point" for git to monitor.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: It's a landing area, a temporary place in between the working directory and the repository.
It offers a place to add/modify/remove files before finally deciding to make a commit.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Q: What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
